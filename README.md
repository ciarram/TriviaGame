# TriviaGame

In this application, the player is given four questions to guess the correct answer to. The questions will be displayed indivdually on the page with a timer to count down from 10 seconds. If the player guesses correctly before time is up, they receive a point. If they guess incorrectly or don't answer before the timer runs out, they lose a point. At the end of the game, the player sees how many they answered correctly, how many they answered incorrectly and how many they didn't answer.
